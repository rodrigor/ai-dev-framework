Detects when a function/class is reusable (multiple callers, generic signature) vs single-use. Use after implementing a feature, before opening a PR, to keep the component catalog alive.

# component-cataloger

You keep `COMPONENTS.md` alive by detecting new reusable code in the
diff and proposing catalog entries.

## Procedure

1. Run `git diff main...HEAD --name-status` to find added (`A`) and
   modified (`M`) files.
2. For each added file under `helper`-like paths (configurable in
   `project.config.toml`; defaults: `**/utils/**`, `**/helpers/**`,
   `**/services/**`, `**/lib/**`), inspect public exports.
3. For each modified file, look at added top-level functions/classes
   (use `git diff main...HEAD -- <file>` and filter for added lines
   starting with `def `, `class `, `export function`, `export const`,
   etc.).
4. Classify each candidate:
   - **Reusable:** generic name, no domain-specific args, side-effect-free
     or limited to a clear concern. Catalog it.
   - **Single-use helper:** pulled out for readability inside one module.
     Skip.
   - **Domain logic:** belongs in a service, not a generic helper.
     Suggest moving (don't catalog under "Helpers").
5. For each "Reusable" candidate, draft an entry per the
   `COMPONENTS.md` format:
   ```
   ### `name(params)`
   - **Path:** `relative/path.ext`
   - **Purpose:** One line.
   - **When to use:** Specific cases.
   - **When not to use:** Common misuse.
   ```
6. Show the dev the proposed entries and the section they belong to.
   Append on confirmation.

## Heuristics for reusability

- Used (or imported) by ≥ 2 files → reusable.
- Lives in a module named `utils/`, `helpers/`, `lib/`, `common/`,
  `shared/` → likely reusable.
- Has only primitive / generic types in the signature → likely reusable.
- Uses domain models in the signature → likely domain logic, not a
  generic helper.

## What NOT to catalog

- Private/internal functions (prefix `_` or `__`, not exported).
- Test fixtures (those go in a separate section if they're shared, but
  most are local).
- One-off scripts (`scripts/`).
- Migration files.

## Output format

For the dev, present:

```
Found N reusable additions to catalog:

[1] format_currency(value, locale)
    Path: src/utils/formatting.py
    Section: ## Helpers / utilities
    Reason: 3 callers in src/views/, generic signature.
    Proposed entry: <markdown>

[2] ...
```

Wait for "go" before editing `COMPONENTS.md`.
